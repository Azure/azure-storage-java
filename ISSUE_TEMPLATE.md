### Which service(blob, file, queue, table) does this issue concern?


### Which version of the SDK was used?
Please note that if your issue is with v11, we are recommending customers either move back to v11 or move to v12 (currently in preview) if at all possible. Hopefully this resolves your issue, but if there is some reason why moving away from v11 is not possible at this time, please do continue to ask your question and we will do our best to support you. The README for this SDK has been updated to point to more information on why we have made this decision.
