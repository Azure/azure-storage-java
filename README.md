# Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for Java

This project provides a client library in Java that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Storage services. For documentation, please see the Microsoft Azure [Java Developer Center](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/java/) and the [Java client library reference for Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/storage).

NOTE: There is a new version of this library in development, which supports asynchronous APIs in a reactive model. This entails a significant architectural overhaul and a redesign of the current interface.  If this interests you, please feel free to check it out in the New-Storage-SDK-V10-Preview branch. Feedback is always appreciated. The rest of the document below applies to the existing generally available library.

# Getting Started

## Download
### Option 1: Via Maven

To get the binaries of this library as distributed by Microsoft, ready for use within your project, you can use Maven.

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
	<artifactId>azure-storage</artifactId>
	<version>8.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Option 2: Source Via Git

To get the source code of the SDK via git just type:

    git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java.git
    cd ./azure-storage-java
    mvn compile

### Option 3: Source Zip

To download a copy of the source code, click "Download ZIP" on the right side of the page or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java/archive/master.zip). Unzip and navigate to the microsoft-azure-storage folder.

## Minimum Requirements

* Java 1.7+
* [Jackson-Core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core) is used for JSON parsing. 
* (Optional) [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) is a logging facade.
* (Optional) [SLF4J binding](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) is used to associate a specific logging framework with SLF4J.
* (Optional) Maven

The two dependencies, [Jackson-Core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core) and [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/), will be added automatically if Maven is used. Otherwise, please download the jars and add them to your build path. 

SLF4J is only needed if you enable logging through the OperationContext class. If you plan to use logging, please also download an [SLF4J binding](http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/) which will link the SLF4J API with the logging implementation of your choice. Simple is a good default. See the [SLF4J user manual](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) for more information.

## Usage

To use this SDK to call Microsoft Azure storage services, you need to first [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

Samples are provided in the microsoft-azure-storage-samples folder. The unit tests in microsoft-azure-storage-test can also be helpful.

## Code Sample

The following is a quick example on how to upload a file to azure blob and download it back. You may also download and view the samples in the microsoft-azure-storage-samples folder. For additional information on using the client libraries to access Azure services see the How To guides for [blobs](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-java-how-to-use-blob-storage/), [queues](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-java-how-to-use-queue-storage/), [tables](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-java-how-to-use-table-storage/) and the [general documentation](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/java/).

```java
import java.io.*;

import com.microsoft.azure.storage.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.storage.blob.*;

public class BlobSample {
	public static final String storageConnectionString =
		"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;"
		+ "AccountName=your_account_name;"
		+ "AccountKey= your_account_key";

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			CloudStorageAccount account = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);
            CloudBlobClient serviceClient = account.createCloudBlobClient();

            // Container name must be lower case.
            CloudBlobContainer container = serviceClient.getContainerReference("myimages");
            container.createIfNotExists();

            // Upload an image file.
            CloudBlockBlob blob = container.getBlockBlobReference("image1.jpg");
            File sourceFile = new File("c:\\myimages\\image1.jpg");
            blob.upload(new FileInputStream(sourceFile), sourceFile.length());

            // Download the image file.
            File destinationFile = new File(sourceFile.getParentFile(), "image1Download.tmp");
            blob.downloadToFile(destinationFile.getAbsolutePath());
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException fileNotFoundException) {
            System.out.print("FileNotFoundException encountered: ");
            System.out.println(fileNotFoundException.getMessage());
            System.exit(-1);
        }
        catch (StorageException storageException) {
            System.out.print("StorageException encountered: ");
            System.out.println(storageException.getMessage());
            System.exit(-1);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.print("Exception encountered: ");
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            System.exit(-1);
        }
	}
}
```
